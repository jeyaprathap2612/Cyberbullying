# Cyberbullying
This project is about the analysis of tweets about cyberbullying, with the goal of performing a Sentiment Analysis using  Navie bayes and Random Forest Classifier
Primary Goal:
The primary goal of cyberbullying sentiment analysis is to accurately identify and analyze instances of cyberbullying in digital content, such as social media posts, comments, messages, etc. The aim is to automatically detect and categorize content as either indicative of cyberbullying or benign communication.

Solution:

Data Collection: Gather a diverse dataset of digital content containing instances of cyberbullying along with non-cyberbullying content for training the sentiment analysis model.
Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data by removing noise, such as irrelevant symbols, emojis, and special characters.
Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the text data, such as word embeddings or bag-of-words representations.
Sentiment Analysis Model: Develop a machine learning or deep learning model trained on labeled data to classify the sentiment of text as cyberbullying or non-cyberbullying.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the sentiment analysis model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Integration: Integrate the sentiment analysis model into platforms where cyberbullying detection is required, such as social media platforms or messaging apps.
Result:

Accurate Detection: The sentiment analysis model accurately identifies instances of cyberbullying in digital content with high precision and recall.
Timely Intervention: Enables timely intervention by automatically flagging and bringing attention to potentially harmful cyberbullying instances, allowing for prompt action by moderators or users themselves.
Improved Safety: Enhances the safety and well-being of individuals online by creating a more positive and supportive digital environment through the reduction of cyberbullying incidents.
User Awareness: Raises awareness among users about the prevalence of cyberbullying and encourages responsible digital behavior.
Customization: Allows for customization and fine-tuning of the sentiment analysis model to adapt to evolving trends and variations in cyberbullying behavior.
